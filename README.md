This is a personal, and fairly complex project that I've created for me and my brothers to use. 
The project represents what is essentially a tournament management meta game, that doesn't include actual gameplay in the software, but includes many simulation features such as NPCs, leaderboards, brackets, etc.
This is probably my favorite undertaking that i've taken upon myself, but unfortunately it cannot be trivially used by other people as it was created for a very specific purpose.
I am always happy to present it better in a more personal setting.
